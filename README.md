## Generative AI vs Agentic AI

### Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models that can create new content - such as text, images, audio, video, or code - that resembles human-created data. Generative AI is about learning the distribution of data so that it can generate a new sample from it, while, Traditional AI is about fining patterns in data and giving predictions. Example: ChatGPT, CodeLLama, Delli, Elevenlabs, Sora etc are used to creative and business writing, software development, customer support, eduction, designing, . It is constantly evolving and improving. Generative AI or LLM can generate generic data but, RAG base AI or LLM generate specific data for my use, but, both don't have memory, cannot take action and reactive (only give response to a query, never initiated itself reply or action).  

### Agentic AI aims at solving a problem using generative AI and take approval/review from the client before taking action. It is proactive (autonomous i.e. can initiate action itself), has memory to remember past, give specific ouput/data, take take action and can adopt to any unseen changes. Example: we can integrate API of services and Agentic AI can use the API to perform the specified task end to end.

# What is Agentic AI?
Agentic Al is a type of Al that can take up a task or goal from a user and then work toward completing it on its own, with minimal human guidance. It plans, takes action, adapts to changes, and seeks help only when necessary. It is an intelligent system that receives a high-level goal from a user, and autonomously plans, decides, and executes a sequence of actions by using external tools, APIs, or knowledge sources â€” all while maintaining context, reasoning over multiple steps, adapting to new information, and optimizing for the intended outcome.
![AI Agents](/img/image-9.png)

## Key characterstics of Agentic AI
###  Autonomous
Autonomy refers to the Al system's ability to make decisions and take actions on its own to achieve a given goal, without needing step-by-step human instructions.

1. Our Al recruiter is autonomous

2. It's proactive

3. Autonomy in multiple facets

- Execution
- Decision making
- Tool usage

4. Autonomy can be controlled

- **Permission Scope** - Limit what tools or actions the agent can perform independently. (Can screen candidates, but needs approval before rejecting anyone.)
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** - Insert checkpoints where human approval is required before continuing. (Can I post this JD)
- **Override Controls** - Allow users to stop, pause, or change the agent's behaviour at any time. (pause screening command to halt resume processing.)
- **Guardrails / Policies** - Define hard rules or ethical boundaries the agent must follow. (Never schedule interviews on weekends)

5. Autonomy can be dangerous

- The application autonomously sends out job offers with incorrect salaries or terms.
- The application shortlists candidates by age or nationality, violating anti-discrimination laws. 
- The applications spending extra on Linkedin ads.

### Goal Oriented
Being goal-oriented means that the Al system operates with a persistent objective in mind and continuously directs its actions to achieve that objective, rather than just responding to isolated prompts.

1. Goals acts as a compass for Autonomy

2. Goals can come with constraints

3. Goals are stored in core memory

```json
{
"main_goal": "Hire a backend engineer",
"constraints": {
    "experience":"2-4 years",
    "remote": true,
    "stack": ["Python", "Django", "Cloud"]
},
"status": "active",
"created_at":"2025-06-27",
"progress": {
    "JD_created": true,
    "posted_on": ["LinkedIn", "AngelList"],
    "applications_received": 8,
    "interviews_scheduled": 2
    }
}
```

4. Goals can be altered

### Planning
Planning is the agent's ability to break down a high-level goal into a structured sequence of actions or subgoals and decide the best path to achieve the desired outcome.

Step 1: Generating multiple candidate plans
- Plan A: Post JD on LinkedIn, GitHub Jobs, AngelList
- Plan B: Use internal referrals and hiring agencies

Step 2: Evaluate each plan
- Efficiency (Which is faster?)
- Tool Availability (Which tools are available)
- Cost (Does it require premium tools?)
- Risk (Will it fail if we get no applicants?)
- Alignment with constraints (remote-only? budget?)

Step 3: Select the best plan with the help of:
- Human-in-the-loop input (e.g., "Which of these options do you prefer?")
- A pre-programmed policy (e.g., "Favor low-cost channels first")

### Reasoning

Reasoning is the cognitive process through which an agentic ai system interprets information, draws conclusions, and makes decisions - both while planning ahead and while executing actions in real time.

**Reasoning During Planning**:

1. **Goal decomposition** - Break down abstract goals into concrete steps
2. **Tool selection** - Decide which tools will be needed for which steps
3. **Resource estimation** - Estimate time, dependencies, risks

**Reasoning During Execution**:

1. **Decision-making** - Choosing between options (3 candidates match â†’ schedule 2 best, reject 1) 
2. **HITL handling** - Knowing when to pause and ask for help (Unsure about salary range)
3. **Error handling** - Interpreting tool/API failures and recovering

### Adaptability

Adaptability is the agent's ability to modify its plans, strategies, or actions in response to unexpected conditions - all while staying aligned with the goal.

1. Failures (Calendar API)
2. External feedback (Less no of applications)
3. Changing goals (Hiring a freelancer)

### Context Awareness

Context awareness is the agent's ability to understand, retain, and utilize relevant information from the ongoing task, past interactions, user preferences, and environmental cues to make better decisions throughout a multi-step process.
1. **Types of context**

- **The original goal**
- **Progress till now + Interaction history** (Job description was finalized and posted to LinkedIn & GitHub Jobs)
- **Environment state** (Number of applicants so far = 8 or LinkedIn promotion ends in 2 days)
- **Tool responses** (Resume parser â†’ "Candidate B has 3 years Django + AWS experience or Calendar API "No conflicts at 2 PM Wednesday)
- **User specific preferences** (Prefers remote-first candidates or Likes receiving interview questions in a Google Doc)
- **Policy or Guardrails**(Do not send offer without explicit user approval or Never use platforms that require paid ads unless approved)

2. **Context awareness is implemented through memory**

3. **Short term memory**

4. **Long term memory**

## Components of Agentic AI
### **Brain**

**Goal Interpretation** : Understands user instructions and translates them into objectives.
**Planning** : Breaks down high-level goals into subgoals and ordered steps.
**Reasoning** : Makes decisions, resolves ambiguity, and evaluates trade-offs.
**Tool Selection** : Chooses which tool(s) to use at a given step.
**Communication** : Generates natural language outputs for humans or other agents.
example: llm

### **Orchestrator**

**Task Sequencing** : Determines the order of actions (step 1-step 2 â†’...).
**Conditional Routing** : Directs flow based on context (e.g., if failure, retry or escalate).
**Retry Logic** : Handles failed tool calls or reasoning attempts with backoff.
**Looping & Iteration** : Repeats steps (e.g., keep checking job apps until 10 are received).
**Delegation** : Decides whether to hand off work to tools, LLM, or human.
example: LangGraph, Microsoft AutoGen, CrewAI and Semantic Kernel etc.

### **Tools**

**External Actions** : Perform API calls (e.g., post a job, send an email, trigger onboarding).
**Knowledge Base Access** : Retrieve factual or domain-specific information using RAG or search tools to ground responses.
example: API

### **Memory**

**Short-Term Memory** : Maintains the active session's context-recent user messages, tool calls, and immediate decisions.
**Long-Term Memory** : Persists high-level goals, past interactions, user preferences, and decisions across sessions.
**State Tracking** : Monitors progress: what's completed, what's pending (e.g., "JD posted", "Offer sent").

### **Supervisor**

**Approval Requests (HITL)** : Agent checks with human before high-risk actions (e.g., sending offers).
**Guardrails Enforcement** : Blocks unsafe or non-compliant behavior.
**Edge Case Escalation** : Alerts humans when uncertainty/conflict arises.

## Tools:
A tool is just a Python function (or API) that is packaged in a way the LLM can understand and call when needed. NOTE: These tools are also runnables. Documentation and list of all available tools https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/.
LLMS (like GPT) are great at:
    â€¢ Reasoning(Think)
    â€¢ Language generation(Text Generation or Speak)
But they can't do things like:
    â€¢ Access live data (weather, news)
    â€¢ Do reliable math(difficult mathematics)
    â€¢ Call APIs(post a tweet on tweeter)
    â€¢ Run code
    â€¢ Interact with a database
![Types of Tools](/img/image-6.png)

### How Tools fits into the Agent ecosystem?
An Al agent is an LLM-powered system that can autonomously think, decide, and take actions using external tools or APIs to achieve a goal.
![Agent=LLM+Tools](/img/image-7.png)

**Built-in Tools**: A built-in tool is a tool that LangChain already provides for you -it's pre-built, production- ready, and requires minimal or no setup. You don't have to write the function logic yourself - you just import and use it.
    DuckDuckGoSearchRun     Web search via DuckDuckGo
    WikipediaQueryRun       Wikipedia summary
    PythonREPLTool          Run raw Python code
    ShellTool               Run shell commands
    RequestsGetTool         Make HTTP GET requests
    GmailSendMessageTool    Send emails via Gmail
    SlackSendMessageTool    Post message to Slack
    SQLDatabaseQueryTool    Run SQL queries

**Custom Tools**
A custom tool is a tool that you define yourself.
Use them when:
    â€¢ You want to call your own APIs
    â€¢ You want to encapsulate business logic
    â€¢ You want the LLM to interact with your database, product, or app

Ways to create Custom Tools
    â€¢ using @tool decorator
    â€¢ using Structured Tool & Pydantic
    â€¢ Using Base Tool class
![Ways to create tools](/img/image-8.png)

A **Structured Tool** in LangChain is a special type of tool where the input to the tool follows a structured schema, typically defined using a Pydantic model. The best way to make enforce constants and most used in production.

**BaseTool** is the abstract base class for all tools in LangChain. It defines the core structure and interface that any tool must follow, whether it's a simple one-liner or a fully customized function.
All other tool types like **@tool, Structured Tool** are built on top of BaseTool. Used to perform multiple asynchronous functions unlike in tool decorator and Structured Tool.


**Toolkits**: A toolkit is just a collection (bundle) of related tools that serve a common purpose- packaged together for convenience and `reusability`.
In LangChain:
    â€¢ A toolkit might be: GoogleDriveToolKit
    â€¢ And it can contain the following tools
    â€¢ `GoogleDriveCreateFileTool`: Upload a file
    â€¢ `GoogleDriveSearchTool`: Search for a file by name/content
    â€¢ `GoogleDriveReadFileTool`: Read contents of a file

**Tool Binding** is the step where you register tools with a Language Model (LLM) so that:
1. The LLM knows what tools are available
2. It knows what each tool does (via description)
3. It knows what input format to use (via schema)

## Tool Calling:
It is the process where the LLM (language model) decides, during a conversation or task, that it needs to `use a specific tool (function)` â€” and generates a structured output with:
- the `name of the tool`
- and the `arguments` to call it with

The LLM `does not actually run the tool` - it just `suggests` the tool and the input arguments. The `actual execution is handled by LangChain or you`.

"What's 8 multiplied by 7?"
The LLM responds with a tool call:

```json
{
"tool": "multiply",
"args": { "a": 8, "b": 7 }
}
```

**Tool Execution** is the step where the **actual Python function (tool)** is run using the input arguments that the **LLM suggested during tool calling**.

In simpler words:
    The LLM says:
    "Hey, call the `multiply` tool with a=8 and b=7,"
    Tool Execution is when you or LangChain actually run:
    `multiply(a=8, b=7)`
    â†’ and get the result: `56`

## **ReAct** : 
ReAct is a design pattern used in AI agents that stands for Reasoning + Acting. It allows a language model (LLM) to interleave internal reasoning (Thought) with external actions (like tool use) in a structured, multi-step process.
Instead of generating an answer in one go, the model thinks step by step, deciding what it needs to do next and optionally calling tools (APIs, calculators, web search, etc.) to help it. It loop over `thought`, `action` and `observation`(`answer`) till get the `final answer`.

```bash
Thought: I need to find the capital of France.
Action: search_tool
Action Input: "capital of France"
Observation: Paris

Thought: Now I need the population of Paris.
Action: search_tool
Action Input: "population of Paris"
Observation: 2.1 million

Thought: I now know the final answer.

Final Answer: Paris is the capital of France and has a population of ~2.1 million.
```

ReAct is useful for:
- Multi-step problems
- Tool-augmented tasks (web search, database lookup, etc.)
- Making the agent's reasoning `transparent and auditable`

It was first introduced in the paper:
    "ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models" (Yao et al., 2022)

### Create the ReAct agent
```bash
agent = create_react_agent(
    llm=llm,
    tools=[search_tool, get_weather_data],
    prompt=prompt
)
```

### langchain's hub's ReAct Template:
```bash
Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

{tools}

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin!

Question: {input}
Thought:{agent_scratchpad}
```

**Agent & Agent Executor**
`AgentExecutor` orchestrates the `entire loop`:
1. Sends inputs and previous messages/thought trace/Agent Scratchpad(initially empty) to the agent 
2. Gets the next `action` from agent
3. Executes that tool with provided input
4. Adds the tool's `observation` back into the history
5. Loops again with updated history until the agent says `Final Answer`.


### Creating Agent Executor
```bash
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent,
    tools=[search_tool, get_weather_data],
    verbose=True # To show what the agent is thinking.
)
```

# What is Langchain?
LangChain is an open-source library designed to simplify the process of building LLM based applications. It provides modular building blocks that let you create sophisticated LLM-based workflows with ease. LangChain can be used to create Simple conversational workflows like Chatbots, Text Summarizers, Multistep workflows, RAG applications, Basic level agents etc.

### LangChain consists of multiple components
- **Model** components gives use a unified interface to interact with various LLM providers
- **Prompts** component helps you engineer prompts
- **Retrievers** component helps you fetch relevant documents from a vector store
- **Chains** component helps to create chain of more than one langchain components.

# What is LangGraph?
**LangGraph** is an orchestration framework that enables you to build **stateful**, **multi-step**, and **event-driven** workflows using large language models (LLMs). It's ideal for designing both **single-agent** and **multi-agent** agentic Al applications.
Think of LangGraph as a **flowchart engine for LLMs** - you define the steps (nodes), how they're connected (edges), and the logic that governs the transitions. LangGraph takes care of **state management**, **conditional branching**, **looping**, **pausing/resuming**, and **fault recovery** - features essential for building robust, production-grade Al systems.

### LangChain Vs LangGraph
- Workflow used in LangChain is created by developer and remain the same, while workflow used in LangGraph is created by the LLM by directing their own processes and tool usage, mainitaining control over how they accomplish tasks.
- LangChain is stateless an, while LangGraph is statefull.
- LangChain is used when you're building simple, linear workflows like a prompt chain, summarizer, or a basic retrieval system, while LangGraph is used when the case involves complex, non-linear workflows that need Conditional paths, Loops, Human-in-the-loop steps, Multi-agent coordination, Asynchronous or event-driven execution etc.

### Why LangGraph exits?

- **Control Flow Complexity** in LangChain because of glue codes (conditional branches, jumps and loops), while no glue code in LangGraph.
- dificulty in **State Handling** (**Data handling**) i.e. manually have to update the state of the workflow, while in LangGrahp, we create a state object with the help of Pydantic or typedict and each node get the state update its value and return the state again.
- LangChain execute in **sequential** fashion, while LangGraph do **Event Driven** Execution.
- LangChain is not **Fault Tolerant** than LangGraph. LangGraph offer small level fault (retry logic), big/system level fault (recovery using checkpointers). 
- LangChain cannot handle **Human in the Loop** for long time.
- **Nested Workflows** each node in the graph can itself be a complete graph. the subgraphs created using it helps to create multiagent system and increase reusability.
- **Observability** is partial and difficult in LangChain, but easy in LangGraph. This is one using **LangSmith**.
- LangGraph is built on top of LangChain (LangGraph doesn't replace LangChain). LangGraph handles workflow orchestration, while LangChain provides the building blocks (ChatOpenAI (LLMs), PromptTemplate, Retrievers, Document Loaders, Tools, etc.) for each step in that workflow.

### LLM workflow
1. LLM workflows are a step by step process using which we can build complex LLM applications.
2. Each step in a workflow performs a distinct task - such as prompting, reasoning, tool calling, memory access, or decision-making.
3. Workflows can be linear, parallel, branched, or looped, allowing for complex behaviours like retries, multi-agent communication, or tool-augmented reasoning.

### Graphs, Nodes and Edges
The system generates an essay topic, collects the student's submission, and evaluates it in parallel on depth of analysis, language quality, and clarity of thought. Based on the combined score, it either gives feedback for improvement or approves the essay.

1. **Generate Topic**
- System generates a relevant UPSC-style essay topic and presents it to the student.
2. **CollectEssay**
- Student writes and submits the essay based on the generated topic.
3. **EvaluateEssay (Parallel Evaluation Block)**
- Three evaluation tasks run in **parallel**:
- **EvaluateDepth** - Analyzes depth of analysis, argument strength, and critical thinking.
- **EvaluateLanguage** - Checks grammar, vocabulary, fluency, and tone.
- **EvaluateClarity** - Assesses coherence, logical flow, and clarity of thought.
4. **AggregateResults**
- Combines the three scores and generates a total score (e.g., out of 15).
5. **Conditional Routing**
- Based on the total score:
- If score meets threshold go to ShowSuccess
- If score is below threshold go to GiveFeedback
6. **GiveFeedback**
- Provides targeted suggestions for improvement in weak areas.
7. **CollectRevision** (optional loop)
- Student resubmits the revised essay.
- Loop back to **EvaluateEssay**
8. **ShowSuccess**
- Congratulates the student and ends the flow.

### State
In LangGraph, state is the shared memory that flows through your workflow - it holds all the data being passed between nodes as your graph runs.

```python
    essay text: str
    topic: str
    depth_score: int
    language_score: int
    clarity_score: int
    total_score: int
    feedback: Annotated [list[str], add]
    evaluation_round: int
```

### Reducers,
Reducers in LangGraph define how updates from nodes are applied to the shared state. Each key in the state can have its own reducer, which determines whether new data replaces, merges, or adds to the existing value.

### LangGraph Execution Model

It is inspired by Google Pragal that processes large scale graphs.

1. **Graph Definition**

You define:
- The **state schema**
- **Nodes** (functions that perform tasks)
- **Edges** (which node connects to which)

2. **Compilation**

You call `.compile()` on the `StateGraph`. This checks the graph structure and prepares it for execution.

3. **Invocation**

You run the graph with `.invoke(initial_state)`. LangGraph sends the initial state as a **message** to the entry node(s).

4. **Super-Steps Begin**
Execution proceeds in **rounds**. In each round (super-step):
- All **active nodes** (those that received messages) run in **parallel**
- Each returns an **update** (message) to the state

5. **Message Passing & Node Activation**
The messages are passed to downstream nodes via edges. Nodes that receive messages become active for the **next round**.

6. **Halting Condition**
Execution stops when:
- No nodes are active, and
- No messages are in transit

## Sequential Workflows

## Parallel Workflows

## Conditional Workflows

## Iterative Workflows


### What is Streaming
In LLMs, streaming means the model starts sending tokens (words) as soon as they're generated, instead of waiting for the entire response to be ready before returning it.

### Why Streaming
1. Faster response time - low drop-off rates
2. Mimics human like conversation (Builds trust, feels alive and keeps the user engaged)
3. Important for Multi-modal Uls
4. Better UX for long output such as code
5. You can cancel midway saving tokens
6. You can interleave UI updates, e.g., show "thinking...", show tool results


# LangSmith

### Observability : 
 Observability is the ability to understand a system's internal state by examining its external outputs, like logs, metrics, and traces. It allows you to diagnose issues, understand performance, and improve reliability by analyzing data generated by the system. Essentially, it's about being able to answer "why" something is happening within a system, even if you didn't anticipate the problem. It helps mitigate hallucination in RAG, debugging in Agents, and latency in LLMs.

### Two big problems in LLMs/Agents/Chatbots:
1. Retriever errors â†’ wrong / irrelevant documents retrieved.
2. Generator errors â†’ LLM hallucinates or misuses context.

In production, it's often unclear if the retriever or LLM caused failure. This is why observability is critical.

### LangSmith Overview :

LangSmith is a unified observability & evaluation platform where teams can debug, test, and monitor AI app performance. It tracks execution of application components step by step, capturing at a granular level:
- what input and output each component receives and produces,
- and the time taken.
In LangSmith, an app is called a **project**, each execution is a **trace**, and each componentâ€™s execution is called a **run**.

### What does LangSmith Trace?
1. Input and Output (User query, LLM prompt (with inserted docs), Retrieved documents and LLM response)
2. All the intermediate steps
3. Latency
4. Token usage
5. Cost
6. Error
7. Tags
8. Metadata (helps in search and debugging)
9. Feedback

### LLM Workflows as Graphs

LangSmith treats an LLM application as a workflow, which can be represented as a graph where each node represents a task. When graphs become complex, debugging and managing them is difficult â€” LangSmith solves this. Every graph execution is logged in LangSmith as a trace. Each node (retriever, LLM, tool call, subgraph, etc.) becomes a run inside the trace. You can visualize the path: START â†’ Retriever â†’ Reranker â†’ LLM Answer â†’ END. If a workflow branches (conditional / parallel / subgraph), LangSmith records which path was executed. By default, LangSmith only tracks the LLM or chain invocation, not PDF loading, chunking, or embedding functions, this can be resolved using @traceable decorator.

## Monitoring and Alerting

### What it does:
Monitoring in LangSmith looks across many traces at once to track the overall health of your LLM system. It aggregates metrics like latency (P50, P95, P99), token usage, cost, error rates, and success rates. Alerts can be configured to notify you when metrics drift outside acceptable ranges (e.g., latency spikes, higher error rates, or unexpected cost increases).

### Why it matters:
In production, issues often appear as patterns across multiple runs rather than in a single trace. Monitoring catches these early before they impact users. Instead of waiting for customer complaints, LangSmith proactively alerts you when performance degrades or costs spike, enabling faster responses and more reliable applications.

## Evaluation

### What it does:
Evaluation in LangSmith measures the quality of LLM outputs. You can run tests against gold-standard datasets or apply evaluation metrics like faithfulness, relevance, or completeness. Supported methods include:
- Automated scoring (LLM-as-a-judge),
- Semantic similarity checks,
- Custom Python evaluators.
Evaluations can run offline (batch, pre-deployment) or online (continuous on live traffic).

### Why it matters:
LLM behavior is unpredictable â€” small changes in prompts, models, or retrieval may improve some cases but break others. Evaluation ensures objective, repeatable performance tracking, preventing regressions and validating improvements.

### Example: For a RAG chatbot, you might evaluate:
- Faithfulness â†’ Are answers grounded in retrieved documents?
- Relevance â†’ Did the response address the userâ€™s question?
By running the same dataset across GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA, you can compare models or pipeline setups.

## Prompt Experimentation

### What it does:
LangSmith allows A/B testing of different prompt versions. Prompts are tested on the same dataset, evaluated against metrics, and results are logged over time. This builds a history of which prompts perform best under what conditions.

## Dataset Creation & Annotation

### What it does:
- Tools to build datasets for evaluation and fine-tuning.
- Supports manual annotation (e.g., labeling correctness).
- Stores versioned datasets for reuse across projects.

### Why it matters:
High-quality datasets are essential for evaluation and feedback loops. Example:
- Customer support â†’ dataset of common Q&A for benchmarking RAG agent updates.

## User Feedback Integration

### What it does:
- Capture thumbs up/down, ratings, or structured feedback from production users.
- Feedback is logged alongside traces, tied to prompts, models, and states.
- Enables bulk analysis of user preferences.

## Collaboration

### What it does:
- Team members can view, share, and comment on traces, datasets, and evaluations.
- Web UI enables non-engineers (PMs, QA, annotators) to inspect and annotate runs.
- Supports shared dashboards for experiments.
